This project is a habit and task tracker. The user will enter tasks and assign them to a specific weekday. Users can also add habits to the tracker. Habits will be assigned to everyday of the week. Habits will be initially set to incomplete(false). Tasks will also be set to incomplete.
Users can then choose a menu option to mark habits and tasks as completed.
The built-in menu also supports a reporting feature. Users can opt to view either a weekly or daily report.
The program has an additional feature of displaying to the user all habits and tasks before marking any as complete.
I hope yu enjoy the program.
